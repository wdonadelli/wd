# WD Web Libraries

This project consists of the distribution of two libraries for web application development.

The *Web Development* tool consists of a library written in JavaScript whose purpose is to provide various tools to give dynamism and agility to the application in development. This tool is divided into two segments, one based on the JavaScript code (**WD JavaScript Tools**) and another based on the attributes of the HTML elements (**WD Attributes Tools**).

The *Web Design* tool (**WD Style Sheet**) consists of a library written in CSS whose purpose is to provide the styling of the developing application by means of basic class attributes.
